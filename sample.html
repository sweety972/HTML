       <h3> A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and interact with content on the World Wide Web. It acts as a client that communicates with web servers using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to request web pages, which are then displayed on the userâ€™s device. When a user enters a URL or clicks on a link, the browser sends a request to the server hosting that website, receives the content (usually HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), and renders it into a readable and interactive format. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera, and Brave.

Web browsers are capable of displaying text, images, videos, animations, and running scripts to create interactive web applications. They have built-in features like tabs, bookmarks, history, developer tools, privacy modes (e.g., incognito), extensions/add-ons, and security settings. Browsers interpret and render content using a rendering engine (e.g., Blink in Chrome, Gecko in Firefox, WebKit in Safari). They also handle background processes like managing cookies, storing cache, and protecting users against malicious websites and phishing attacks. In essence, the web browser is the primary tool for users to explore the internet, interact with websites, stream content, use online services, and access cloud-based applications.</p>
